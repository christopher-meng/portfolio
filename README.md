This is an archive of my work that has utilized R over the years (whether a small or significant portion of the project). Unfortunately, due to a server transfer, some of my R files were lost, which is why I am missing code for the visuals in the multilingual students presentation. Below is a short summary of each project in this repo.

## Modeling U.S. Homicide Rate

For my linear regression course, we fit a multiple linear regression model to crime data provided by the FBI to explore the following question: "Which variables have relatively significant effects on the homicide rate in the U.S. in 2019?" 

## Multilingual Students

For my multilingual writing class, I conducted a survey of Pomona College students on their linguistic experiences in their respective first-year college seminars called ID1. ID1 is supposed to help first-year students transition to college-level writing and discussion. The presentation summarizes my research project. I was interested in the following research questions:

* What are students' linguistic backgrounds that they bring to ID1?
* What are their perceptions of and explanations for code-switching?

## Comparing the WTA-ATP Professional Tennis Tours

For my computational statistics course, we applied data science tools to visualize and explore differences between the female and male professional tennis tours in order to possibly explain discrepancies in their respective public perceptions. A Shiny app with some of our results can be found at the following link: https://alanyiyu.shinyapps.io/shiny/

## Comparing U.S.-Taiwan 8th Grade Math TIMSS Performance

For my independent study, I fit hierarchical linear models, or linear mixed effects models, to TIMSS 2015 data for 8th grade math in order to compare factors affecting performance in U.S. and Taiwan.

## Transfer Students

I was hired to help explore survey data for Swarthmore transfer students. I created a Shiny app and summarized my findings here: https://cmeng.shinyapps.io/shiny/

## Gradeless 9th Grade Fall

For an assignment for my master's program, I chose to explore the "gradeless 9th grade fall" at Marin Academy. I created and adminstered a survey for all 9th graders during the 2024-2025 school year and facilitated a 30-minute professional development session at the end of the school year to collectively discuss and evaluate gradeless fall. I built a Shiny app for my colleagues to explore the survey data: https://chrismeng41.shinyapps.io/GradelessFall2024/
